[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dashpay/bitcore-dash.svg?branch=master&style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/dashpay/bitcore-dash)

Infrastructure to build Dash and blockchain-based applications for the next generation of financial technology.

**Note:** If you're looking for the Bitcore-Dash Library please see: https://github.com/dashpay/bitcore-lib-dash

## Getting Started

Before you begin you'll need to have Node.js v4 or v0.12 installed. There are several options for installation. One method is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily switch between different versions, or download directly from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

First make sure to have already installed basic build prerequisites and libzmq3-dev.

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libzmq3-dev
```

Download this branch from github and install it globally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashpay/bitcore-dash -b dev-testnet
cd bitcore-dash
npm install -g
```

Spin up a full node and join the network:

```bash
bitcored
```

You can then view the Insight block explorer at the default location: `http://localhost:3001/insight`, and your configuration file will be found in your home directory at `~/.bitcore`.

Create a transaction:
```js
var bitcore = require('bitcore-dash');
var transaction = new bitcore.Transaction();
var transaction.from(unspent).to(address, amount);
transaction.sign(privateKey);
```
